## Project info
### Purpose of project
A brief description for the project
### Sourcing the data
Please include any details (if any) for sourcing the data, if not already part of the pipeline
### Instructions for running the pipeline
If `kedro run` is not the only step needed, please explain how the pipeline should be run

## Overview

This is your new Kedro project, which was generated using `Kedro 0.18.2`.

Take a look at the [Kedro documentation](https://kedro.readthedocs.io) to get started.

## Rules and guidelines

In order to get the best out of the template:

* Don't remove any lines from the `.gitignore` file we provide
* Make sure your results can be reproduced by following a [data engineering convention](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/12_faq/01_faq.html#what-is-data-engineering-convention)
* Don't commit data to your repository
* Don't commit any credentials or your local configuration to your repository. Keep all your credentials and local configuration in `conf/local/`

### Naming convention for data
The nodes should have outputs in the corresponding data folders, i.e. the nodes that are part of the `primary_pipeline`
under `src/<package_name>/pipeline.py` should import function(s) from `src/{{ cookiecutter.python_package }}/nodes/primary.py` and 
should output datasets to the `data/03_primary` folder.

Data folder/node | Purpose |
--- | --- | 
01_raw | Raw datasets/ direct downloads from s3 or Athena query results |
02_intermediate | Basic renaming of columns and defining dtypes |
03_primary | Joining dataframes, basic NaN filling that will not be experimented in model fitting |
04_feature | Feature engineering |
05_model_input | Split of X/y and train/test; set index of dataframes as you see fit |
06_models | Save model, attach predictions to datasets, SHAP values, model evaluation |
07_model_output | Impact of model on metrics, SHAP values, model evaluation |
08_reporting | YOLO |


## Create a new virtual environment
### Using poetry
poetry will use the pyproject.toml and poetry.lock files to configure the virtual env
```shell
poetry shell
```

### Set up PyCharm
* PyCharm -> Preferences (`âŒ˜,`)
* Click on Project -> Python Interpreter
* Choose the virtual env you have just created (most likely need to find the python<version> file within the bin folder)

## How to install dependencies

Dependencies are declared in pyproject.toml, and all package inter-dependencies resolved and logged in poetry.lock
```shell
poetry install
```


## How to run your Kedro pipeline

You can run your Kedro project with:

```
kedro run
```

## How to test your Kedro project

Have a look at the file `src/tests/test_run.py` for instructions on how to write your tests. You can run your tests as follows:

```
kedro test
```

To configure the coverage threshold, go to the `.coveragerc` file.

## Project dependencies

To add new dependency requirements for your project:

```
poetry add <new-package-name>
```


## How to work with Kedro and notebooks

> Note: Using `kedro jupyter` or `kedro ipython` to run your notebook provides these variables in scope: `context`, `catalog`, and `startup_error`.
>
> Jupyter, JupyterLab, and IPython are already included in the project requirements by default, so once you have run `kedro install` you will not need to take any extra steps before you use them.

### Jupyter
To use Jupyter notebooks in your Kedro project, you need to install Jupyter:

```
poetry add jupyter
```

After installing Jupyter, you can start a local notebook server:

```
kedro jupyter notebook
```

### JupyterLab
To use JupyterLab, you need to install it:

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

You can also start JupyterLab:

```
kedro jupyter lab
```

### IPython
And if you want to run an IPython session:

```
kedro ipython
```

### How to convert notebook cells to nodes in a Kedro project
You can move notebook code over into a Kedro project structure using a mixture of [cell tagging](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#release-5-0-0) and Kedro CLI commands.

By adding the `node` tag to a cell and running the command below, the cell's source code will be copied over to a Python file within `src/<package_name>/nodes/`:

```
kedro jupyter convert <filepath_to_my_notebook>
```
> *Note:* The name of the Python file matches the name of the original notebook.

Alternatively, you may want to transform all your notebooks in one go. Run the following command to convert all notebook files found in the project root directory and under any of its sub-folders:

```
kedro jupyter convert --all
```

### How to ignore notebook output cells in `git`
To automatically strip out all output cell contents before committing to `git`, you can run `kedro activate-nbstripout`. This will add a hook in `.git/config` which will run `nbstripout` before anything is committed to `git`.

> *Note:* Your output cells will be retained locally.


## Deployed pipelines
Dockerfiles have been included as starting templates:
* `Dockerfile` for the actual image to be used in ECR

### Building the image
Run the below commands to add ssh config and build the image
```shell script

docker build -t <image-tag> .
```
Running the test image (env variables already set there)
```shell
docker run <image-tag>
```
